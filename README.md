# Simple python program to get data from an Allen Bradley PLC to an excel sheet.
It still needs a bit of refinement but it does work.

I have added the small test program( v32) and the excel sheet it creates.

For V2 it will only write data to excel if new data.
Revised the GUI for much cleaner look.

Working on a way to view excel sheet data in a gridview like space....well see...
4-11-25 removed unused import from main file.
4-20-25:  Added Gridview like table at bottom of page to keep track in real time the data being read. ( see photo in Instructions )
